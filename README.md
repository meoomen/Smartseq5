# Smartseq5
Example scripts to aid the analysis of Smart-seq+5' data as used in our [publication](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)01426-0). 

These scripts should not be used out-of-the-box, they are intended to help the understanding of the computational separation of 5' fragments and internal (ELSE) fragments and in general the first processing steps of Smart-seq+5' data. Please adapt the script to work for your computational setup.

Additionally, one can find the softwares and their versions used in the conda environments. 

For more information see the methods section of our manuscript.

Please contact Marlies Oomen (marlies.oomen@helmholtz-munich.de) for any questions.

### Looking for the shiny app? 
We have a website for easy exploring of our data through the [shiny app](https://embryo.helmholtz-munich.de/shiny_embryo/). 
However, the website might be down or under construction when you're reading this. Want to run the app locally? Please visit https://github.com/meoomen/shiny_embryo for instructions, data and shiny scripts.
