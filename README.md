# Smartseq5
Example scripts to aid the analysis of Smart-seq+5' data. 

These scripts should not be used out-of-the-box, they are intended to help the understanding of the computational separation of 5' fragments and internal (ELSE) fragments and in general the first processing steps of Smart-seq+5' data. Please adapt the script to work for your computational setup.

Additionally, one can find the softwares and their versions used in the conda environments. 

For more information see the methods section of our manuscript.
