# Smartseq5
Scripts to aid the analysis of Smart-seq+5' data. 
These scripts should not be used out-of-the-box, but are intended to help the understanding of the computational separation of 5' fragments and internal (ELSE) fragments and in general the first processing steps of Smart-seq+5' data. Please addapt the script to work for your computational setup.

Additionally, one can find the softwares and their versions used in the conda environments. 

Please contact Marlies Oomen (marlies.oomen@helmholtz-munich.de) for any questions.
